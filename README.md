 Udacity Project - Recommendations_with_IBM
 
My name is Aseem Narula, a RPA consultant (….in simple words we make software bots….) and a aspiring Data Scientist currently enrolled and pursuing my journey by learning with the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

This is all about explaining the exciting ML project on IBM Recommendations based on the the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. 

The project notebook is divided into the 

I. Exploratory Data Analysis
II. Rank Based Recommendations
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
V. Matrix Factorization
